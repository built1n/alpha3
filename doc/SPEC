Alpha-3
=======
Alpha-3 is a RISC architecture with 256 32-bit registers.
Register 255 is the program counter
Register 0 contains a permanent zero
Byte ordering is BIG-ENDIAN.

Most instructions are in the format of OP XX YY ZZ
Instruction Set
===============
?? denotes that a byte is ignored
* denotes a byte

Load/Store
==========
0x00 ?? XX YY - XX->YY
0x01 ?? XX YY - (XX)->YY
0x02 ?? XX YY - XX->(YY)
0x03 XX *  *  - **->XX_HI (destructive to high half)
0x04 XX *  *  - **->XX_LO (destructive to low half)
0x05 ?? XX YY - EXCHG XX YY

Arithmetic
==========
0x06 XX YY ZZ - XX+YY->ZZ
0x07 XX YY ZZ - XX-YY->ZZ
0x08 XX YY ZZ - XX*YY->ZZ
0x09 XX YY ZZ - XX/YY->ZZ
0x0A XX YY ZZ - XX%YY->ZZ

Flow Control
============
0x0B XX YY ZZ - XX==YY, ZZ->R255
0x0C XX YY ZZ - XX!=YY, ZZ->R255
0x0D XX YY ZZ - XX<YY, ZZ->R255
0x0E XX YY ZZ - XX>YY, ZZ->R255
0x0F XX YY ZZ - XX<=YY, ZZ->R255
0x10 XX YY ZZ - XX>=YY, ZZ->R255

Bitwise Ops.
============
0x11 XX YY ZZ - XX AND YY->ZZ
0x12 XX YY ZZ - XX OR YY->ZZ
0x13 XX YY ZZ - XX XOR YY -> ZZ
0x14 XX YY ZZ - XX LSH YY -> ZZ
0x15 XX YY ZZ - XX RSH YY -> ZZ
0x16 ?? XX YY - NOT XX -> YY

Port I/O
========
There are 256 ports, starting at 0. They can have an 8-bit value written to them.
If the port number or output byte is greater than 255, then only the low byte is used.

0x17 *  XX YY - OUTB XX->YY
0x18 *  XX YY - INB XX->YY

Usage of Ports
==============
Port 0 is the terminal output port (out only)
Port 1 is the keyboard input port (in only)
Port 32 is the file I/O port (bi-directional)
Port 128 is the control port (out only)
 - Execution will stop when 0xFF is written to this port
 - File opening will commence if 0x80 is written to this port
   - The null-terminated file name, in ASCII, will be written
   - Then, the contents of the file can be read and written through port 32
   - The file can be closed by writing 0x80 to this port again
Port 255 is the capabilities port (out only)
 - Bit 0 (LSB) specifies if keyboard input is supported
 - Bit 1 specifies if terminal output is supported
 - Bit 2 specifies if file I/O is supported
