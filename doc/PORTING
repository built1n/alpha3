Porting Alpha-3
===============

Alpha3 is written to be very portable, and uses an abstraction layer to perform platform-specific tasks, such as opening a file or reading from the keyboard.

To port Alpha-3 to a new platform, simply edit the platform.c abstraction layer to suit your needs.

struct alpha_ctx has a void pointer for the implementor to use to implement file access.
